Thucydides, who was an Athenian general, provides an analytical approach to history, focusing on the political and military strategies, as well as the human motivations behind the conflict. His work is considered one of the first examples of \"scientific history\" because he avoids mythology and relies on facts, eyewitness accounts, and rational analysis.\n",

What makes a good leader? What is the ideal society? The book introduces the concept of the \"philosopher-king\" and the allegory of the cave, which are central ideas in Western thought. It's a fascinating read if you're interested in morality, politics, and human behavior.\n",

It's essentially his private journal, filled with reflections on how to live a virtuous life, face challenges, and maintain inner peace. Though Marcus was Roman, Stoicism has deep roots in Greek philosophy, particularly in the teachings of Epictetus and Zeno.\n",

Miller brings the characters to life with vivid emotional depth, exploring themes of love, fate, and heroism. It's a beautifully written story that immerses you in the world of ancient Greece while reinterpreting the timeless myth.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **\"Circe\" by Madeline Miller**  \n",
      "This novel reimagines the life of Circe, a minor character from Homer's Odyssey. Miller gives her a voice and a complex backstory, portraying her as a powerful yet isolated figure navigating the world of gods and mortals. The book is rich with themes of identity, transformation, and the struggle for independence.\n",
